abstract = "We discuss a way of characterizing probability distributions, complementing that provided by the celebrated notion of information measure, with reference to a measure of complexity that we call a “nontriviality measure”. Our starting point is the “LMC” measure of complexity advanced by López-Ruiz et al. (Phys. Lett. A 209 (1995) 321) and its analysis by Anteneodo and Plastino (Phys. Lett. A 223 (1997) 348). An improvement of some of their troublesome characteristics is thereby achieved. Basically, we replace the Euclidean distance to equilibrium by the Jensen–Shannon divergence. The resulting measure turns out to be (i) an intensive quantity and (ii) allows one to distinguish between different degrees of periodicity. We apply the “cured” measure to the logistic map so as to clearly exhibit its advantages."

Three public data sets were used: (i) Mobile Century data set collected on Highway I-880, near Union City, California; (ii) Borl\"ange GPS data set collected in the Swedish city of Borl\"ange; and (iii) Beijing taxicabs data set collected in Beijing, China, where each vehicle speed is stored as a time series. The Bandt-Pompe methodology combined with the Complexity-Entropy plane were used to identify different regimes and behaviors. The global velocity is compatible with a correlated noise with $f^{-k}$ Power Spectrum with $k \ge 0$. With this we identify traffic behaviors as, for instance, random velocities ($k\approx 0$) when there is congestion, and more correlated velocities ($k \approx 3$) in the presence of free traffic flow.},

The proposal uses the Shannon entropy, the statistical complexity, and the Fisher information evaluated over the Bandt and Pompe symbolization of the horizontal and vertical coordinates of signatures. These six features are easy and fast to compute, and they are the input to an One-Class Support Vector Machine classifier. The results are better than state-of-the-art online techniques that employ higher-dimensional feature spaces which often require specialized software and hardware. We assess the consistency of our proposal with respect to the size of the training sample, and we also use it to classify the signatures into meaningful groups.},

Lett. 88 (2002) 174102], a successfully symbolic encoding scheme, based on the ordinal relation between the amplitude of neighboring values of a given data sequence, from which the permutation entropy can be evaluated. Equalities in the analyzed sequence, in example, repeated equal values, deserve special attention and treatment as was shown recently by Zunino and coworkers [Phys. Let. A 381 (2017) 1883]. Significant number of equal values can give rise to false conclusions regarding the underlying temporal structures in practical contexts. In the present contribution, we review the different existing methodologies for treats time series with ties values by classifying them according to their different strategies. In addition, a novel data-driven imputation is presented that proves to outperform the existing methodologies and avoiding the false conclusions pointed by Zunino and coworkers.}

abstract = { Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are growing in popularity as a complement or alternative to the traditional command line interfaces to R. RGtk2 is an R package for creating GUIs in R. The package provides programmatic access to GTK+ 2.0, an open-source GUI toolkit written in C. To construct a GUI, the R programmer calls RGtk2 functions that map to functions in the underlying GTK+ library. This paper introduces the basic concepts underlying GTK+ and explains how to use RGtk2 to construct GUIs from R. The tutorial is based on simple and pratical programming examples. We also provide more complex examples illustrating the advanced features of the package. The design of the RGtk2 API and the low-level interface from R to GTK+ are discussed at length. We compare RGtk2 to alternative GUI toolkits for R.},
