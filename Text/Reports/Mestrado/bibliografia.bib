Three public data sets were used: (i) Mobile Century data set collected on Highway I-880, near Union City, California; (ii) Borl\"ange GPS data set collected in the Swedish city of Borl\"ange; and (iii) Beijing taxicabs data set collected in Beijing, China, where each vehicle speed is stored as a time series. The Bandt-Pompe methodology combined with the Complexity-Entropy plane were used to identify different regimes and behaviors. The global velocity is compatible with a correlated noise with $f^{-k}$ Power Spectrum with $k \ge 0$. With this we identify traffic behaviors as, for instance, random velocities ($k\approx 0$) when there is congestion, and more correlated velocities ($k \approx 3$) in the presence of free traffic flow.},

The proposal uses the Shannon entropy, the statistical complexity, and the Fisher information evaluated over the Bandt and Pompe symbolization of the horizontal and vertical coordinates of signatures. These six features are easy and fast to compute, and they are the input to an One-Class Support Vector Machine classifier. The results are better than state-of-the-art online techniques that employ higher-dimensional feature spaces which often require specialized software and hardware. We assess the consistency of our proposal with respect to the size of the training sample, and we also use it to classify the signatures into meaningful groups.},

Lett. 88 (2002) 174102], a successfully symbolic encoding scheme, based on the ordinal relation between the amplitude of neighboring values of a given data sequence, from which the permutation entropy can be evaluated. Equalities in the analyzed sequence, in example, repeated equal values, deserve special attention and treatment as was shown recently by Zunino and coworkers [Phys. Let. A 381 (2017) 1883]. Significant number of equal values can give rise to false conclusions regarding the underlying temporal structures in practical contexts. In the present contribution, we review the different existing methodologies for treats time series with ties values by classifying them according to their different strategies. In addition, a novel data-driven imputation is presented that proves to outperform the existing methodologies and avoiding the false conclusions pointed by Zunino and coworkers.}

abstract="One of the main problems of SAR imagery is the presence of speckle noise, originated by the inherent coherent nature of this type of systems. For one-dimensional SAR systems it has been demonstrated that speckle can be considered as a multiplicative noise term. Nevertheless, this simple model cannot be exported when multidimensional SAR imagery is addressed. This paper is devoted to present the latest advances into the definition of a multidimensional speckle noise model which does not depend on the data dimensionality. Speckle noise may be modeled by multiplicative and additive noise sources, whose combination is determined by the data's correlation structure. The validity of the proposed model is demonstrated by its application to a real L-band multidimensional SAR dataset acquired by the German ESAR sensor.",

    abstract = {Complexity measures are essential to understand complex systems and there are numerous definitions to analyze one-dimensional data. However, extensions of these approaches to two or higher-dimensional data, such as images, are much less common. Here, we reduce this gap by applying the ideas of the permutation entropy combined with a relative entropic index. We build up a numerical procedure that can be easily implemented to evaluate the complexity of two or higher-dimensional patterns. We work out this method in different scenarios where numerical experiments and empirical data were taken into account. Specifically, we have applied the method to  fractal landscapes generated numerically where we compare our measures with the Hurst exponent;  liquid crystal textures where nematic-isotropic-nematic phase transitions were properly identified;  12 characteristic textures of liquid crystals where the different values show that the method can distinguish different phases;  and Ising surfaces where our method identified the critical temperature and also proved to be stable.},

abstract="A new generalized Statistical Complexity Measure (SCM) was proposed by Rosso et al in 2010. It is a functional that captures the notions of order/disorder and of distance to an equilibrium distribution. The former is computed by a measure of entropy, while the latter depends on the definition of a stochastic divergence. When the scene is illuminated by coherent radiation, image data is corrupted by speckle noise, as is the case of ultrasound-B, sonar, laser and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors. In the amplitude and intensity formats, this noise is multiplicative and non-Gaussian requiring, thus, specialized techniques for image processing and understanding. One of the most successful family of models for describing these images is the Multiplicative Model which leads, among other probability distributions, to the                                                                           {\$}{\backslash}mathcal G^0{\$}                 law. This distribution has been validated in the literature as an expressive and tractable model, deserving the ``universal'' denomination for its ability to describe most types of targets. In order to compute the statistical complexity of a site in an image corrupted by speckle noise, we assume that the equilibrium distribution is that of fully developed speckle, namely the Gamma law in intensity format, which appears in areas with little or no texture. We use the Shannon entropy along with the Hellinger distance to measure the statistical complexity of intensity SAR images, and we show that it is an expressive feature capable of identifying many types of targets.",
